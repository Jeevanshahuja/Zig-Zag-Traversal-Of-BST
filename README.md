## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. In this traversal, nodes are visited level by level, alternating the order between left-to-right and right-to-left at each level.

### Solution Approach

The solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach with the help of a queue to traverse the binary tree level by level. To alternate the order:
1. **Track Levels**: Use a `level` counter to identify whether the current level should be traversed from left-to-right or right-to-left.
2. **Dynamic Insertion**: Depending on the level, insert values at the start or end of the temporary list (`temp`).
3. **Queue for Traversal**: Use a queue to store nodes for the next level and process them in FIFO order.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize an empty result list `ans` and a queue `q`.
2. Perform BFS, processing nodes level by level.
3. For each node:
   - Add its value to the temporary list in the appropriate order based on the level.
   - Add its children (left and right) to the queue for processing the next level.
4. After processing each level, append the temporary list to the result.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), accounting for the space used by the queue and the result list.
